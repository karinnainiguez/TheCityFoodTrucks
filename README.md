# TheCityFoodTrucks

Welcome to the Command Line Interface tool designed to find open food trucks in the city of San Francisco. 

## Usage

This tool is built using Golang.  You will need to have [Go installed on your computer, your Go Workspace created, and the path to that workspace stored in your ``GOPATH`` ](https://www.callicoder.com/golang-installation-setup-gopath-workspace/). 

Clone this repository in your GOPATH.  Within the TheCityFoodTrucks folder, run the following commands to install dependencies and the tool: 

```
 üçï /TheCityFoodTrucks $ go get -d ./...
 üçï /TheCityFoodTrucks $ go build
 üçï /TheCityFoodTrucks $ go install
```

After installation, you may use the ```$ TheCityFoodTrucks ``` command in order to see food trucks in San Francisco currently open.  The results are paginated in groups of 10 trucks per page, and the table will display the truck name, address, and times of operation.

Below are some examples of users running this command at different times:
